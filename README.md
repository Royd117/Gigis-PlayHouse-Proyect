# Gigis-PlayHouse-Proyect
This is an inventory proyect desgined for Gigi's playhouse

I worked on this full-stack proyect in which the goal was to develop an inventory system for Gigi's Playhouse that could register every transaction that was made between the staff that worked with them, also as a requirement the system was able to keep track of the people that worked with them and store important documents of the organization.
